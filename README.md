# cot-4500-intro
The purpose of this assignment is to create matricies using numpy and changing them based on certain instances in the assignment. To run the code, open the code into your IDE of choice and run the code and it will give you the desired outputs. 
To run the code in the command line open the command prompt and then type the c pathway to the file, as shown from my IDE below.
For example:
runfile('/Users/joseph-aidenizzo/intro_to_python.py', wdir='/Users/joseph-aidenizzo')
By running that line in command prompt it will show the 3 desired outcomes. You can also always use copy the code in my file and run it that way as well!
